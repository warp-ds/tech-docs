## Colors in Warp
In Warp Design System we are changing the whole concept of working with colors.
We are no longer picking primitive colors from a palette (like `text-blue-600`), but instead we use semantic colors based on their purpose (like `text-primary`).
This is something that is needed in order to support brand theming and dark mode.
