# Design FAQ

## What’s the latest Tori designs I can look at to see if the things I’m doing is OK?
The most current Tori visual design examples can be found in the Tori native app ([iOS](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/tori-fi/id505943449) [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.schibsted.iberica.tori&hl=en&gl=US&pli=1)), and on the [Autot section](https://autot.tori.fi/) of the Tori website.

## How do I use the styles?
The component library is built using styles from the [FINN - design tokens](https://www.figma.com/file/XmQKT9qPjtAGsgUOvI49NW/FINN---Design-Tokens?type=design&node-id=12%3A4311&t=L4kPZEgVHBAe9jEO-1) library. This is a Figma library that contains only styles (and no components). This library is turned on, in our Warp component library, and is used to create all the components in the component library. That’s why our component library looks like FINN design, by default.

When you are designing in your own file, you will see these FINN styles in your right toolbar, and it’s these styles you can use when designing.
