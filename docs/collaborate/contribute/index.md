# Contribute to the growth of Warp

Start by reading the guidelines **[Designing with a design system](/guidelines/design-system/)** and **[When to use Warp](/guidelines/design-system/#when-to-use-warp).** If you have decided that you want to use Warp but you need to extend the design system to fit your needs. This is the guide for you.

In this guide you find all the information you need if you want to contribute to the growth of Warp.

- Adding component
- Making changes to an existing component
- Being part of the early adopters warpies
- How to collaborate with us

## Adding a new component

Things to consider when requesting a new component:

- Does something similar exist? If yes, Can you use it with a tweak? See “request changes to an existing component”
- If no: Is this something that benefits more than just your team?
- What variants and use cases do you see?

Reach out to the Warp team on slack #nmp-warp-design-system with your request or join the Warp Office Hours and we will help you. If you are not working in Schibsted you can [fill in this form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfs54AvPDtDdJNsN0-YeAxHV-6Qd5V2p4EJo7qEzLlCu9Pe_g/viewform).

## Requesting changes to an existing component

Things to consider when requesting a change to a component:

- How does this change affect the overall product?
- If no: Is this something that benefits more than just your team?
- What variants and use cases do you see?

Reach out to the Warp team on slack #nmp-warp-design-system with your request or join the Warp Office Hours and we will help you. If you are not working in Schibsted you can [fill in this form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfs54AvPDtDdJNsN0-YeAxHV-6Qd5V2p4EJo7qEzLlCu9Pe_g/viewform).

### Prioritisation of component requests

We prioritise the requests based on:

- How many teams will benefit from this component? (Never less than 2)
- How complicated or time consuming is it to build this component?
- Is this already in our roadmap for future components?
