# Contribute to the growth of Warp

Start by reading the guidelines **[Designing with a design system](/guidelines/design-system/)** and **[When to use Warp](/guidelines/design-system/#when-to-use-warp).**
If you have decided that you want to use Warp, but you need to extend the design system to fit your needs.
This is the guide for you.

## Requesting changes to an existing component

Things to consider when requesting a change to a component:

- How does this change affect the overall product?
- If no, is this something that benefits more than just your team?
- What variants and use cases do you see?

Reach out to the Warp team on slack [#nmp-warp-design-system](https://sch-chat.slack.com/archives/C04NF2K46LB) with your request, and we will help you.
If you are not working in Schibsted you can [fill in this form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfs54AvPDtDdJNsN0-YeAxHV-6Qd5V2p4EJo7qEzLlCu9Pe_g/viewform).

## Adding a new component

Things to consider when requesting a new component:

- Does something similar exist? If yes, can you use it with a tweak? See “request changes to an existing component” below.
- If no, is this something that benefits more than just your team?
- What variants and use cases do you see?

Reach out to the Warp team on Slack: [#nmp-warp-design-system](https://sch-chat.slack.com/archives/C04NF2K46LB) with your request, and we will help you.

### Prioritisation of component requests
We prioritise the requests based on:

- How many teams will benefit from this component? (Never less than 2)
- How complicated or time-consuming is it to build this component?
- Is this already in our roadmap for future components?
