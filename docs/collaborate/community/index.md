# Join the community

We are always available in our Slack channel ([#nmp-warp-design-system](https://sch-chat.slack.com/archives/C04NF2K46LB)),
and we really want that to be a blossoming place for all kinds of community driven discussions,
where anyone should be able to ask questions and engage in discussions about how to take our design system to the next level. 

## Being part of the early adopters Warpies

We have a small invite only early adopters group that we use to help us test out new concepts, gather ideas and feedback from.
We meet bi-weekly and expect you to give a few hours a month to this work.
In return, youâ€™ll have a great impact on our roadmap and have a say in most decisions we make for the future of Warp.

Are you interested in joining the group? Send us a message in [#nmp-warp-design-system](https://sch-chat.slack.com/archives/C04P0GYTHPV)
