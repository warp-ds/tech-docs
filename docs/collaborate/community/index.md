# Join the community

We are always available in our slack channel #nmp-warp-design-system and we really want that to be a blossoming place for all kinds of community driven discussions where all and everyone should be able to ask questions and engage in discussions about how to take our design system to the next level.

Besides our slack channel we also have two formats for collaborating with the design systems team on a more structural basis.

## Warp Open Forum

### Purpose

For designers and engineers that are working with the design system in the development phase. Do you want feedback and discussions with a larger crowd? This is a low key meeting for both feedback and everything else design systems related. The Warp team might talk about and demonstrate new stuff. This is the place to be if you want to keep up with Warp.

Representatives from our different functions, (Design, Web, Apps) and representatives from both product, design and tech in the Warp team are joining this meeting.

### Target group

Nordic Marketplace designers and Warp engineers. The agenda for the open forum can be found in the calendar invite and an updated agenda will be posted in our #nmp-warp-design-system slack channel prior to the meeting.

*If you have questions about component usage please bring them to the Office hours instead.*

### When?

Every third Thursday of the month. Please sign up through the link in the calendar invite if you have a topic you want to discuss.

We will make time for open questions at the end of each Forum.

## Warp Office Hours

### Purpose

Designers can reach out and get feedback on how they are using the design system and our different brands' digital guidelines. This is the place to be when you want to suggest new components or updates to existing components.

Do you have a design you think should be a component or a template? Right place to bring it up!

### Target group

Designers that work with, or are about to start working with the design system.

Engineers that have questions about usage of a component are welcome to reach out to set up a meeting anytime using our #nmp-warp-design-system channel.

### When?

Mondays between 2-3.30pm CET. Not always at the office, but always available remotely. Ping us on Slack or send a calendar invite and we will show up.

## Being part of the early adopters warpies

We have a small invite only early adopters group that we use to help us test out new concepts, gather ideas and feedback from. We meet bi-weekly and expect you to give a few hours a month to this work. In return youâ€™ll have a great impact on our roadmap and have a say in most decisions we make for the future of Warp.
