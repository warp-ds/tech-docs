# Join the community

We are always available in our Slack channel, and we really want that to be a blossoming place for all kinds of community driven discussions where anyone should be able to ask questions and engage in discussions about how to take our design system to the next level. 

Besides our Slack channel we also have two formats for collaborating with the design systems team on a more structural level.


## Warp Office Hours

### When?

Every Monday between 14:00 - 15:30 (15:00-16:30 in ðŸ‡«ðŸ‡®Finland) we are hosting Warp office hours.

Come around and ask questions, get feedback on sketches or your code.
Login to [this Google meet](http://meet.google.com/qee-nqsf-qeu), or reach out in [#nmp-warp-design-system](https://sch-chat.slack.com/archives/C04P0GYTHPV) on Slack to schedule a meeting.

### Purpose

Designers can reach out and get feedback on how they are using the design system and our different brands' digital guidelines. This is the place to be when you want to suggest new components or updates to existing components.

Do you have a design you think should be a component or a template? Right place to bring it up!

### Target group

Designers that work with, or are about to start working with the design system.

Engineers that have questions about usage of a component are welcome to reach out to set up a meeting anytime using our #nmp-warp-design-system channel.

## Being part of the early adopters warpies

We have a small invite only early adopters group that we use to help us test out new concepts, gather ideas and feedback from. We meet bi-weekly and expect you to give a few hours a month to this work. In return, youâ€™ll have a great impact on our roadmap and have a say in most decisions we make for the future of Warp.
