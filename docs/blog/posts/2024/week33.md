# How to Update Your Web Apps for DBA with stable releases

### Packages to Install from NPM

| Package Name        | Version        |
|---------------------|----------------|
| `@warp-ds/css`      | `2.0.0`        |
| `@warp-ds/uno`      | `2.0.0`        |
| `@warp-ds/react`    | `2.0.0`        |
| `@warp-ds/vue`      | `2.1.0`        |
| `@warp-ds/elements` | `2.0.0`        |
| `@warp-ds/icons`    | `2.1.0-next.2` |

If you have already followed the [previous instructions for the DBA beta changes](https://warp-ds.github.io/tech-docs/blog/posts/2024/warp-2-0) and have disabled EIK import mapping for `react`, `vue` & `elements`, you can now re-enable it.
