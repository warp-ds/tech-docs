# Designing with a design system

We think of Warp as a foundation that you can start building your house upon. Our design system provides you with building blocks that you can use to piece your home together, and it's 100% up to you to puzzle them together so that they meet the needs of your unique users.

Don't limit your ideas to fit into an existing system in the early stages of your design process. Zoom out and figure out the best solutions to the problem that you are solving today. When you have a solution, check if Warp has all the pieces that you need to design that solution. If you canâ€™t find what you are looking for, it's a great time to **[contribute](/collaborate/contribute/)** to the system and help it grow.

## The power of zooming out

The problems we face in Nordic Marketplaces never exist only in one area of a vertical. Zooming out when solving problems allows you to get a better understanding of the problem you are currently trying to solve. You need to consider your vertical as a whole when designing for its parts. You can create better designs and leverage on our existing patterns if you first do your homework and familiarise yourself with the Warp documentation.

## Be free to explore

When you have broad knowledge of the vertical that you belong to, you have the resources you need to explore without constraints. Don't think too much of components, documentation and what patterns we have decided we should use. Start with solving your problem in several different ways before you start thinking about design system consistency.

## Align and tweak with the design system

When you have your potential solutions at hand - talk to your peers. We can help each other out to start aligning more closely with the design system.
