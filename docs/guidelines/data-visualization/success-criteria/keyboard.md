# Keyboard navigation

The charts should be easy to operate through keyboard interaction, in addition to pointer interaction.

Everything that can be done through pointer interaction (eg. click or hover), should be achievable through keyboard interaction as well. In order to make that navigation smooth, interactive elements should be easily identifiable and have focus outlines and the focus order should be in a logical order.

For charts that have custom interaction on their data points (eg. hover reveals a tooltip), the elements will need to be made interactive, and the interaction might need custom controls (eg. using the arrow keys to navigate in the chart while the chart is in focus). Such interaction will need to be explained, since it's not the same across browsers and products.
