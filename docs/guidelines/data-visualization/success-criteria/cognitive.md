# Cognitive accessibility

Our graphs should be easy to understand for everyone. Therefore, we use clear language and explain terminology, data and interaction where needed. Clear titles, descriptions and labels can give more context to the data. Legends can explain categorisation, and in-line labelling and annotations can guide the user.


## 1. Use plain language

Avoid long and difficult words. Explain abbreviations that readers might not be familiar with.

## 2. Include a descriptive title
![Red design tag](/dataviz-tag-design.svg) 

Explain what the graph is about. For example, what data or variables are presented. Can also include the message of the graph.

## 3. Provide a summary or description
![Red design tag](/dataviz-tag-design.svg) 

If not described in the title, include information about the data or variables that are presented. If possible, include a description of the main insight of the graph.

## 4. Use clear data labels
![Red design tag](/dataviz-tag-design.svg) 

A data label is a text element that explains what data point or value you are looking at. Where possible, labels should be in-line (close to the number or visual data element.) If data labels are presented on hover they should also be made available using keyboard navigation and for screen readers.

## 5. Explain colour coding

Make sure to explain colour coded categories in the graph, and use a legend if necessary.

When possible, avoid using a legend and [label data directly](https://depictdatastudio.com/accessibility-quick-wins-remove-legends-and-directly-label/). For legends to work the user must be able to associate the legend with the corresponding elements in the chart, which can be challenging for many. 

In any case you don’t need a legend if you only have one data category.

## 6. Communicate statistical uncertainty
![Red design tag](/dataviz-tag-design.svg) 

In case there is unvcertainty in the underlying data this shoulc be communicated to the user, in text and/or visually. 

## 7. Provide context
![Red design tag](/dataviz-tag-design.svg) 

Numbers in isolation can be hard to understand. Consider if it easier to understand the information if you provide context. For example:
- Historical trend: are we doing better than last week?
- Compared to others: are we doing better than average?
- Compare to something else. Example: emissions as a number of people flying London–New York is easier to understand than tonnes of CO2.

## 8. Label the axes
![Red design tag](/dataviz-tag-design.svg) 

Explain what the axes mean. Preferably using a text label znext to the axes.

## 9. Explain unconventional charts
![Red design tag](/dataviz-tag-design.svg) 

You can assume that most people know how bar charts or line charts work. But if you use an unconventional or uncommon chart, make sure that the users get an explanation of how to read it.

## 10. The data/chart is not misleading
![Red design tagn and blue tech tag](/dataviz-tag-design-and-tech.svg)

Make sure that the data is collected, calculated and filtered in a trutful way. For example, watch out for gaps or biases in the dataset.

When presenting the data, make it clear:
- Where the data comes from
- What is included and excluded
- If there might be any gaps or biases in the data.

Also, make sure to choose a chart type that is appropriate for showing the data.
