# Screen reader accessibility

Data and insights should be accessible for people using screen readers.

We want to make sure that all data that's accessible for sighted users is also accessible for those using screen readers, which can be achieved through either turning the chart into an image with alternative text, adding table alternatives (recommended fallback) or adding additional screen reader information to the visual elements. In addition, screen reader users should get the same insights, with the same ease, as sighted people.
