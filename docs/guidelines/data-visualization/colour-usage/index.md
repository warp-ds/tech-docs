# Colour usage in data visualisation

Colour plays a pivotal role in data visualisation. It is among the initial aspects we perceive on a screen and can be strategically utilised to guide a user's focus.

Not only does colour capture attention, but it also serves as a tool to convey information. This can be achieved by assigning different colours to represent distinct values, or to indicate positive or negative outcomes.

Nonetheless, considering the variability in colour perception among individuals (including those who may not perceive it at all), it's crucial to ensure that the information remains accessible to all (see [Success criteria](/guidelines/data-visualization/success-criteria/) for further details).
