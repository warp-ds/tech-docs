# Colour usage for data visualisation

Colour is highly important in data visualisation. Colour is one of the first things we perceive on a screen, and can be used to direct the usersâ€™ attention. 

Colour can also be used to convey information, for example by using different colours for representing different values, or for indicating something good or bad. 

However, since people see colours differently (or not at all), we need to make sure the information is accessible for everyone (see [Success criteria](/guidelines/data-visualization/success-criteria/)).

This page will provide guildelines for colour usage in graphs. We have not yet decided on colours, nor implemented colour tokens for data visualisation in NMP.
