# Getting Started

These guidelines are primiary for customer facing products and services, but can also be used for internal graphs and visualisations.

## What is data visualisation?

Data visualisation is a visual representation of data, and includes graphs, charts, maps and diagrams. These guidelines focus on visualisation of quantitative data in graphs and charts.

When creating a visualisation from data we encode data into visual attributes such as shape, colour, size, position, length and angle.

## Why should you visualise data?

Data visualisation can help you convey information in a clear and engaging way. In particular, data visualisation makes it easier for people to:

- Compare numbers and other values
- Understand trends and patterns
- Discover outliers.

In addition, visualisations are often easier and quicker to digest and remember than large amounts of text and numbers.

## What is a good visualisation?

A good visualisation communicates insight in a clear and engaging way without the need of somebody to explain the insight to you. Don’t be afraid to add some text to make the visualisation clear. The best visualisations enable users to take action based on the insights they get from the visualisation.

## What do you need to think about?

When you create visualisations you want to:

1. **Answer real questions**<br>
    Visualisation is not a goal in itself, so don’t visualise data just because you can. Show information in the best way you can to make it useful and actionable for your users.
    
2. **Present data honestly**<br>
    Be truthful and transparent when presenting information in order to gain trust.
    
3. **Choose clarity and understanding over wow**<br>
    The purpose of our visualisations is to create insight. Beauty can be a bonus, but should not be your primary goal.
    
4. **Make the information accessible for everyone**<br>
    Make the information available in multiple ways so that all users can benefit from it.
    

## How do you define the goal of your visualisation?

Before you make a visualisation it can be useful to define the goal of the visualisation. One way of doing so is to answer to core questions,

Should your visualisation be explanatory or exploratory?

- **Explanatory**: your visualisation explains or communicates a specific story or insight to someone. In this case, you need to figure out what story to tell, and how to tell it.
- **Exploratory**: users should explore data freely and find their own insight, for example in an analytical dashboard. In this case, you need to figure out how they are going to do that, for example using filters and sorting.

## Which visualisation library should you use?
