# Chart Type

A chart is a visual representation of data that tells a specific story. You need to choose the chart that most clearly communicates the main insight you want to convey.

## Chart functions

In order to find a good chart it is useful to figure out what you want to show about the data. In other words, what function the chart should serve.

The most common functions are:
- **Comparison**. Compare two or more values
- **Correlation.** See the relationship between two or more values
- **Distribution.** See how values are spread out within one variable
- **Trend over time**. See how values change over time
- **Part to whole**. See the composition of a whole
- **Geolocation**. See the geographical distribution of a particular variable.

For a full overview of different chart types you can use for different functions, have a look at the [DataViz Project](https://datavizproject.com/). Below are a few of the most common chart types.

- **Do:** The distance between the bars should be about 20-40 % of the width of the bars.
- **Donâ€™t**: include more than 30 bars in one chart. Consider combining bars into larger units (for example days into weeks) or use a line chart instead.


### Line chart

- **Trend over time**. See how values change over time
