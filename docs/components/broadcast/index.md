# Broadcast
Broadcast automatically fetches broadcast messages for the current (or a given) url.

Uses toast apis under the hood.

__N.B.__ Broadcast should only be included once per page to avoid duplicate broadcast messages being displayed. The preferred method for including broadcast will soon be a podlet provided by the communication team. In the meantime this component can be used directly.
