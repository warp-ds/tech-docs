## Accessibility

To be accessible, an `aria-label` prop should be provided to the slider. If the slider is labeled by a separate element, use the `labelledby` prop with the id of the labeling element instead.

## Events

The slider accepts an `onChange` prop which is triggered whenever the value is changed by the user. Note that this value updates as the user is dragging.
