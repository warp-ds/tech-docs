# Combobox (also known as an autocomplete or autosuggest)

A combobox is the combination of an `<input type="text"/>` and a list. The list is designed to help the user arrive at a value, but the value does not necessarily have to come from that list. Don't think of it like a `<select/>`, but more of an input with some suggestions. You can, however, validate that the value comes from the list, that's up to your app.

<components-status react='released' />
