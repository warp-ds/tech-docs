# Badge

Badge is used for showing a small amount of non-interactive color-categorized metadata, like a status or count.
Since there is no built-in functionality to a badge, there is no need for a component.
Badge style is simply applied by adding css classes to an element.

## Example

<theme-switcher />

<badge-example />
