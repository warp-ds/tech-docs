# Getting started for designers

Hello ðŸ‘‹ welcome to Warp! If you are just getting started with designing for Nordic Marketplaces you are in the right place. Warp is the design system for all different marketplaces. 

## Checklist to get you started
- Install Figma and enable the Warp components library 
- Read up on the brand foundations documentation
- Familiarise yourself with our components and documentation
- Read our guidelines for designing with a system 

## Figma, Warp component overview & Libraries

In Nordic marketplaces we use Figma as the main tool for all our design related tasks. Licences are provided by e-tech and you will find the Figma application while logging in to OKTA. Please see [Figma Downloads](https://www.figma.com/downloads/) to get started with the desktop application of your choice.

### Warp components overview

The work as a designer in Nordic marketplaces comes in various shapes and sizes and therefore we have created an overview for components with things we think you need to get you started.

The overview contains all our components, their variants, existing themes and documentation for usage. We suggest you start exploring the documentation of the Warp components to get familiar with the Warp design system.

### Get the libraries

1. Sign in to Figma with our Schibsted SSO and request access to the Figma team called Warp Design System.
2. Turn on the libraries by navigating to the **Main menu** in Figma and selecting **Libraries** from the list.
    - In the **library modal** turn on the library called: **Warp component library**
        
    *You can have as many libraries as you want turned on but we suggest that you turn off the **Fabric core library** while migrating.*
        
3. Turn on / or keep the **Fabric Icons library** turned on to get access to the Fabric icons

4. Turn on the **Finn - Design tokens** library to enable FINN themed components in your file

## Foundations documentation

The foundations of Warp are currently based on the Fabric design system and therefore have a FINN flavour. The future plans for the foundations of the system is to create a shared design language within Nordic Marketplaces.
