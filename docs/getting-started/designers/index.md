## Figma, Warp component overview & libraries

In Nordic Marketplaces we use Figma as the main tool for all our design related tasks. Licenses are provided by e-tech and you will find the Figma application while logging in to [Okta](https://schibsted.okta.com/app/UserHome). Please see [Figma Downloads](https://www.figma.com/downloads/) to get started with the desktop application of your choice.

### Warp components overview

The work as a designer in Nordic marketplaces comes in various shapes and sizes and therefore we have created an overview for components with things we think you need to get you started.

The overview contains all our components, their variants, existing themes and documentation for usage. We suggest you start exploring the documentation of the Warp components to get familiar with the Warp design system.

Here you can find the [Warp Components overview in Figma](https://www.figma.com/file/nkiRpuVu6XRfvY96BA80H8/01.-Component-overview?type=design&node-id=202-8914)

## Foundations documentation

The foundations of Warp are currently based on the Fabric design system and therefore have a FINN flavour. The future plans for the foundations of the system is to create a shared design language within Nordic Marketplaces.
