## Installation

The Warp React package can be installed from NPM

### with npm:
```shell
npm install @warp-ds/react
```

### with pnpm
```shell
pnpm add @warp-ds/react
```

## Using Components

Once installed, components can be imported into your app by name.

```js
import { Box } from '@warp-ds/react';
```

You can find the specific import statement to import each component on that
component's documentation page. For example, here's the [button page](/components/buttons/)


## TypeScript support

The components are written in TypeScript. To take advantage of this, make sure
your project is up to date on the latest `@types/react` definitions.

```shell
npm install @types/react -D
```
